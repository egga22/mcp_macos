1. **Implement All MCP Tools**:
   - Screenshot capture with inline display
   - Mouse actions (click, move, scroll, drag-and-drop)
   - Keyboard input and text typing
   - Application launching and window management
   - File system operations (if available)

2. **Enhanced Tool Execution**:
   - Add coordinate scaling for different screen resolutions
   - Implement safety confirmations for destructive actions
   - Add tool execution feedback and status updates
   - Handle tool errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

3. **Image Handling**:
   - Display screenshots directly in the chat interface
   - Add image zoom/fullscreen capabilities
   - Implement proper image loading states

### Technical Requirements:
- Use TypeScript throughout
- Maintain existing code architecture
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Ensure type safety for all new features
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add appropriate logging for debugging

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] LLM integration works with natural language commands
- [ ] All MCP tools are accessible through chat
- [ ] Screenshots display properly in the interface
- [ ] Tool execution provides real-time feedback
- [ ] Error handling works for all edge cases
- [ ] Conversation context is maintained across interactions

### Files to Focus On:
- `backend/src/services/llmService.ts` (OpenRouter integration)
- `backend/src/services/chatService.ts` (conversation orchestration)
- `backend/src/services/mcpClient.ts` (tool integration)
- `frontend/src/components/Chat/MessageBubble.tsx` (image display)
- `frontend/src/components/Chat/TypingIndicator.tsx` (loading states)

## üé® Phase 3 Prompt: Polish & Production Ready

### Context
You have completed Phase 2 with working LLM integration and full macOS control. The application now needs polish, optimization, and production-readiness. The core functionality works but needs refinement for real-world usage.

### Your Mission - Phase 3: Polish & Production (5-7 days)
**Goal**: Transform the working prototype into a production-ready application

### Specific Tasks to Complete:

#### 3.1 User Experience Enhancement (Priority: HIGH)
**Objective**: Create a professional, polished user interface with excellent UX

**Tasks**:
1. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Implement dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
   - Enhance the chat interface with better spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
   - Add smooth animations and transitions (loading states, message appearance)
   - Improve responsive design for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Add proper focus management and accessibility features

2. **Settings & Configuration**:
   - Create a settings panel for user preferences
   - Add MCP server connection configuration
   - Implement chat history management (clear, export)
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - User preference persistence

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add message search functionality
   - Implement chat session management
   - Add screenshot annotation tools
   - Create command suggestions/autocomplete

#### 3.2 Robustness & Error Handling (Priority: HIGH)
**Objective**: Ensure the application handles all edge cases gracefully

**Tasks**:
1. **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error boundaries in React components
   - Add user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios
   - Handle MCP server disconnections gracefully
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Add proper validation for all user inputs

2. **Security & Protection**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent spam
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Implement session management and timeouts
   - Add CORS configuration for production
